                <p>
                    First of all you need to observer the project in peace mind.You can see the project and draw the
                    pattern in your mind by just observing.all you need to do is somehow understand that what you need
                    to do.By doing this you can step up forward of your Misson.

                    <hr>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    After observing the projrct you need to think about it.Thinking can be about how you will take your
                    first step,how you will apply your observation,how many part or same pattern of your work have, all
                    of these.And lastly you need to think about your deadline too.Make sure you finish your project
                    before the deadline.

                </p>

                    <hr>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Application of your observation and thinking will make your project in real.you just think and
                    observe and thats not going to make any real work,until you apply them.So you must need to apply
                    what you learned before,that will bring your project in light.People see your hard worked result.
