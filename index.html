                <h5>Thinking <hr> </h5>
                <p>
                    After observing the projrct you need to think about it.Thinking can be about how you will take your first step,how you will apply your observation,how many part or same pattern of your work have, all of these.And lastly you need to think about your deadline too.Make sure you finish your project before the deadline.

                <h5> Applying <hr> </h5>
                <p>
                    Application of your observation and thinking will make your project in real.you just think and observe and thats not going to make any real work,until you apply them.So you must need to apply what you learned before,that will bring your project in light.People see your hard worked result.
